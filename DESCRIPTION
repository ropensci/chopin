Description: Geospatial data computation is parallelized by grid, hierarchy,
    or raster files. Based on future and mirai parallel backends, terra and sf
    functions as well as convenience functions in the package can be distributed
    over multiple threads. The simplest way of parallelizing generic geospatial
    computation is to start from `par_pad_*` functions to `par_grid`,
    `par_hierarchy`, or `par_multirasters` functions. Virtually any functions
    accepting classes in terra or sf packages can be used in the three
    parallelization functions. A common raster-vector overlay operation
    is provided as a function `extract_at`, which uses exactextractr, with
    options for kernel weights for summarizing raster values at vector geometries.
    Other convenience functions for vector-vector operations including
    simple areal interpolation (`summarize_aw`) and summation of
    exponentially decaying weights (`summarize_sedc`) are also provided.
